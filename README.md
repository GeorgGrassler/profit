=== Reduced complexity models ===

This is a collection of scripts to construct reduced complexity models
based on a blackbox simulation code called at different parameters.

Current functionality covers uncertainty quantification via PCE with 
chaospy as a backend. Support for surrogate models via Gaussian Progress 
Regression is under development.
